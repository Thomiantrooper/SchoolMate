Inventory System Overview

We are developing a robust inventory management system using the MERN stack to streamline stock tracking, improve operational efficiency, and enhance business decision-making.

 Key Features
- Real-time Stock Updates â€“ Automatically syncs inventory changes.
- Role-Based Access Control â€“ Ensures secure data management.
- Barcode & QR Code Integration â€“ Simplifies product identification and tracking.
- Automated Alerts & Notifications â€“ Notifies about low stock, restocking, and expiry.
- Advanced Reporting & Analytics â€“ Provides insights for better inventory control.

 New Trends & Innovations Implemented
- GraphQL API Integration â€“ For efficient and flexible data fetching.
- Serverless Functions â€“ Reducing backend complexity and enhancing scalability.
- Microservices Architecture â€“ Decoupling services for improved modularity.
- Progressive Web App (PWA) Support â€“ Enabling offline access and better mobile usability.

## Unique Code Implementations
 Real-time Inventory Updates using WebSockets
       
       javascript
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });

wss.on('connection', ws => {
  ws.on('message', message => {
    console.log(`Received: ${message}`);
    wss.clients.forEach(client => {
      if (client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
        client.send(`Update: ${message}`);
      }
    });
  });
});


 Work Procedure Overview
Below is a simple workflow representation of how our inventory system operates:

User Action -> API Request -> Database Update -> WebSocket Notification -> UI Refresh


With these innovations, our inventory system is scalable, highly secure, and optimized for modern business needs. ðŸš€
