# Inventory Management System (MERN Stack)

This project is a simple yet effective Inventory Management System built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to manage inventory items, track their quantities, and organize them efficiently. This tool is developed with the purpose of stabilizing and enhancing coding knowledge through practical application in a real-world context.

## Features:
- Add, update, and delete inventory items.
- View inventory details with real-time updates.
- User authentication to ensure secure access to the system.
- Responsive design for seamless user experience across devices.

## Tech Stack:
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing inventory data.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **React.js**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side logic.

## Installation:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/inventory-management.git
   
   
2. Install the dependencies:
   - For the backend:
     cd backend
     npm install
     
   - For the frontend:
     cd frontend
     npm install
     

3. Set up environment variables and run the app:
   - Configure `.env` files for both the backend and frontend.
   - Run the server:
       npm run dev

## Still developing and hoping to add more unique features to build the inventory system to the standards of the real world.
