# SchoolMate – School Management System 🎓

## About the Project

SchoolMate is a comprehensive School Management System developed as part of the Information Technology Project Management (ITPM) coursework.  
The system provides an efficient way to manage students, staff, academics, exams, finances, and administrative tasks within a school environment.

SchoolMate is designed to automate and streamline the daily operations of educational institutions. It empowers students to access their learning materials, view homework, track exam schedules, and manage fee payments all in one place. Staff members can efficiently manage student records, academic content, and finances. The administrative panel offers a centralized platform for managing users, generating timetables, and balancing staff workloads using AI. 

With its modular and user-friendly design, SchoolMate bridges communication gaps and enhances operational efficiency within schools, ultimately improving the educational experience for all stakeholders.

Built with a modern technology stack, SchoolMate ensures smooth management of both academic and non-academic activities with easy-to-use portals for Students, Staff, and Administrators.
